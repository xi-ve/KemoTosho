# KemoTosho

Shiru extension for my AnimeTosho clone called KemoTosho.

This is a WIP scraper maintained by me. Things may be wonky, especially when seasons are involved. Report bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/xi-ve/KemoTosho/issues) if you need to.

See [https://tosho.xive.cc](https://tosho.xive.cc) to view new animes getting added and more.

## Installation

1. Open Shiru and go to **Settings > Extensions > Sources**
2. Add this source: `gh:xi-ve/KemoTosho`
